/* General observations */



// With private properties, they only show as `declared` if they are read. If they are only written to, 
// they don't count as declared. 

// When we refer to properties within the class we must use $this->PROPERTY. We can't use $PROPERTY and 
// $this->$PROPERTY counts as a new var declaration so drop the second `$`
